# Fiber-Route Mapping & Management – Market Capacity Snapshot (2024-2034)

| **Stack Layer (what customers buy)** | **2024 Market Value** | **2033-34 Forecast** | **CAGR** | Notes |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------|-------|
| Core **GIS software & services** for telco (desktop licences, hosted portals, GIS-ops outsourcing) | **US $ 2.5 B** | **US $ 5.6 B** (2033) | 8.8 % | Global “GIS in Telecom” category [1] |
| **Fiber-management platforms** (asset registries, splice DBs, OSS/BSS hooks) | **US $ 8.4 B** | **US $ 30.7 B** (2034) | 13.8 % | Fibre-management systems market [2] |
| **Digital-twin & AI network-simulation** (3-D twins of outside-plant + live telemetry) | **US $ 19.8 B** | **US $ 471 B** (2034) | 37.3 % | Whole-of-industry digital-twin market; telco is a fast-growing sub-slice [3] |
| **Total “mapping + management” TAM** (first two rows) | **≈ US $ 11 B** | **≈ US $ 22 B** (2030 est.) | ≈ 12 % | Sum of rows 1-2, linear interpolation |

## Why the pie keeps expanding

| **Growth driver** | **How it widens the TAM** | **Example signal** |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| 5G/6G densification & *“last-five-metres”* fibre build-outs | Every new small-cell or FTTH drop needs route design, splice logging, permitting | AT&T’s **US $ 5.75 B** purchase of Lumen’s mass-market fibre unit, targeting **60 M** passings by 2030 [4] |
| Public-money broadband pushes (U.S. **BEAD**, EU **CEF-Digital**, India **BharatNet**) | Grant rules demand sub-block served/underserved proof → providers buy mapping platforms | State BEAD playbooks uniformly cite FCC/NTIA GIS layers |
| Private-equity roll-ups | Injects capital, sets higher valuation comps | **KKR** paid **£333 M (~US $ 425 M)** for geospatial vendor **IQGeo** (≈ 10 × ARR) [5] |
| Shift from static maps → live **digital twins** | Adds AI/analytics licences on top of GIS seats (price/route-mile can 10-20 ×) | Analysts peg > 37 % CAGR for digital-twin software [3] |
| Edge-to-core automation (self-healing, OTDR robots) | Needs sub-metre topology & continuous QA, driving demand for high-accuracy surveying and pipelines | Vendors now advertise *sensor-ready splice closures* & real-time OTDR feeds |

## Realistic slices a new entrant could chase

| **Player type** | **Revenue model** | **2030 niche size** | **Competitive notes** |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Boutique **GIS/ETL service shop** | US $ 200–500 / route-mile for conversions + retainer | ≈ US $ 2 B | Low cap-ex; margins tighten if telcos insource. Automate QA to stay sticky. |
| SaaS **fibre-asset platform** (e.g. IQGeo, VETRO) | Annual licence + user seats (US $ 10-25 K per 10 K route-miles) | ≈ US $ 6-8 B | Active PE interest; exits at 5-10 × ARR. |
| **Digital-twin integrator** | Consulting + cloud sub, sometimes rev-share on saved Opex | Part of the US $ 471 B digital-twin pot (fibre slice < 5 %) | Land-and-expand if you bring GIS + ML chops. |

### Take-away

*Core fibre-mapping & management software is on track to **double** this decade (≈ US $ 22 B by 2030), while adjacencies like AI-driven digital twins push the broader geospatial-telco spend toward the **US $ 100 B+** range.*  
If you can walk in saying **“I automate the ETL + tile pipeline today and plug it into tomorrow’s digital twin,”** you’re aiming at a market compounding ~12 % a year, with clear appetite for specialised talent and PE capital.
