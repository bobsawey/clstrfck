# clstrfck

An experimental monorepo for random data mining, information retrieval,
research, data analysis, and whatever else seems useful. It's a public
scratch space for dumping thoughts, tools, and datasets. Nothing here is
rigorously tested or validated, but the collection evolves week to week and
gradually becomes more useful, even if it's not particularly novel.

## Embedding and clustering

The `embedding_experiments_1/cluster_embeddings/` package contains two scripts:

- `cluster_chats.py` — embed user/assistant turns with a GGUF embedding model served by `llama-cpp-python` and cluster vectors using scikit-learn K‑Means. It can sweep a range of cluster counts with silhouette scoring and optionally save embeddings.

  ```sh
  python embedding_experiments_1/cluster_embeddings/cluster_chats.py \
    --jsonl conversation_turns.jsonl \
    --model /path/to/bge-base-en-v1.5.Q4_K_M.gguf \
    --best-k --verbose
  ```

- `cluster_chats_basic.py` — a tiny, pure‑Python pipeline that builds a bag‑of‑words vocabulary, creates term‑frequency vectors, and groups them with a lightweight K‑Means. Designed for quick experiments without heavy dependencies.

## Tools

The `tools/` directory hosts miscellaneous helpers:

- **Chat Conversation Viewer:** `chat_conversation_viewer_single_page_tool.html` with documentation in `readme_chat_conversation_viewer_single_page_tool.md`. Open the HTML file in a browser to inspect ChatGPT conversation exports and optionally export SFT‑style JSONL.
- **RLHF data generator:** `generate_rlhf.py` parses conversation dumps and emits SFT segments, DPO pairs, and tool‑usage logs.

## Reference material

Reference documents intended for future data‑mining live in `docs/reference/`.

## Tests

A small pytest suite covers the pure‑Python clustering helpers.

```sh
pytest
```
